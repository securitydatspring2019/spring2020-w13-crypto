# Week-13-Crypto, SSL, Certificates and more
## Thuersday April 30 th (08.30-12.00 for both classes).

_This is going to be a pretty heavy day when it comes to theory. Most of the exercises will not involve code, but steps necessary to understand (conceptually) these terms:
- Symmetric Encryption
- Asymmetric Encryption
- Hashing and Hash Digests
- MAC (Message Authentication Code)
- Digital Signatures
- Certificates
- Certificate Authorities and Certificate Trust Hierarchies
- :red_circle: Cipher Suites

## What to Install

[WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) if not already done. If you have installed Kali Linux, just continue with the version available here.
    
## What to Read or Watch 
- [:tv: Introduction to Cryptographic Keys and Certificates (18. min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9vu6_2r0o4)
- [:tv: What are certificates (15 min.)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRMBZhdFjDI&t=264s) (Covers more or less the same topics as the next video, I do however recomment both)

- [:book: Great Well Illustrated article covering](https://www.zytrax.com/tech/survival/encryption.html#dhe) Cryptographic Overview, Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption, Diffie-Hellman Exchange (only skim text, but WATCH the video), Digests and Hashes, Message Authentication code (MAC),Digital Signatures (20 min.)
- :full_moon: [:book: Cipher Suites (6 min. skim only so you know what it is conceptually)](https://www.jscape.com/blog/cipher-suites) neccesary to understand parts of the Wireshark demo

## Exercises :memo:

- Hand-in for this lecture
  Write down your own agenda, for how you would present the questions given for today. Has this been a hard day, leave out the parts you have found hardest. Remember you will only have 10-15 min for this part at the exam.
